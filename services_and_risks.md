‚ö†Ô∏è Security Risk Analysis
Ports 135, 139, and 445 are well-known for being vulnerable to attacks like malware (e.g., WannaCry ransomware).

These should be firewalled or disabled if not required, especially on publicly exposed systems.

Port 5357 (WSDAPI) is generally safe on local networks but should still be monitored.
